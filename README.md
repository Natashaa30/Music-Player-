<h3>Music Player</h3>

The web-based music player is built using standard HTML elements for structuring the layout, CSS for styling and visual appeal, and JavaScript for controlling the player's behavior.

The code employs the Font Awesome library for icons and leverages a custom CSS style file (style.css) to enhance the appearance of various components. 
The JavaScript (main.js) file contains the logic for loading and playing audio tracks, managing playback, updating track details, and handling seek and volume controls. 

The player uses an array of predefined tracks with associated metadata, including name, artist, image URL, and audio path. 
It dynamically updates the player's interface with the relevant track details when a new track is selected. 
Furthermore, the player implements a random background color function, allowing the background to change colors for each new track, enhancing the user experience with an element of surprise and delight.

It is a simple music player designed to play and manage audio tracks within a web page. 
The player offers basic functionalities like play, pause, previous, and next track controls, as well as a seek slider to navigate through the song's duration and a volume slider to adjust the audio level.

Overall, this simple music player demonstrates the power of combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing audio playback experience within a web browser
